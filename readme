colors.go
========

My dumbest possible dependency, but I copy-paste it to most of my tools, so let's glue up Git to my cmd+v.

It supports only text colors: normal and bright. No background colors just because I don't need them.



Install:

curl -SsL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikonov1101/colors.go/refs/heads/main/colors.go > colors.go

or 

go get -u github.com/nikonov1101/colors.go
